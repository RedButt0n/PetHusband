1. Place CutsceneManager in new empty scene
2. Using TemplateFrame, make all the frames that you want to show in the cutscene
	* Each frame consists of an image and a time (in seconds)
	* The image will be shown full-screen, so must be designed to fit
3. Add each frame as a child of the CutsceneManager
	* The display order will be the order of the list of children (top to bottom)
4. In the CutsceneManager, type the name of the scene which has to load afterwards. Make sure this scene is added in the Build Settings in order for this to work.
